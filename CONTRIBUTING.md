# Contributing to Clock

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🙌  
There are many ways to help improve Clock: reporting issues, translating, or contributing code.

## 📢 Reporting Issues

- Check if the issue already exists ([browse issues](https://github.com/feldmandev/feldman-clock/issues)).
- Ensure it’s still relevant in the latest version.
- Keep it focused on a single topic.
- Use the issue template for clarity.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Issues that ignore the template may be treated with lower priority or even closed.

### Sharing Logs

- **Release builds**  
  To attach logs, please follow these steps:

1. Notice the bug.
2. Go to **About**, click 5 times on the version number.
3. Tap the insect 🐞 icon that appears.
4. Save the generated `.zip` file to your device.
5. Attach the `.zip` file in your issue comment.

- **Nightly & Debug builds**  
  Logs can be accessed directly via the insect 🐞 icon in **About** — no need to click 5 times on the version number.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Providing logs greatly increases the chance of your issue being resolved quickly.

## 🌍 Translation

Translations are managed via [Weblate](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/clock/).

You can also request new languages directly on Weblate if your language is not yet available.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please do not submit translation PRs directly, as they may conflict with Weblate.

## 💻 Code Contribution

### Getting Started

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or another compatible IDE.
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/feldmandev/feldman-clock.git
  cd clock

  ```

- Debug builds need no extra setup. Release builds additionally require a
  `keystore.properties` file — see [Building](README.md#building) in the README.
